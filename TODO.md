Possible improvements on the application design
--

- Provide user control over information and alert time periods;

- Provide the ability to bind reactions to events like alerts and recoveries, or
  to hits at a specific section;

- Provide the ability to follow the stats of specified sections, instead of only
  the greatest hit;

- Parse more than one kind of log file, from more than one kind of application;

- A graphical interface: graphs of load, hits, etc. over time, for example;

- Distributed approach: for example, once the binds are implemented, monitors
  can cooperate for achieving load balancing.
